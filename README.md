# Multi-Line-Text-Writer
***
## Description

This Python project creates a new text file and prompts the user to input any text within a single line. The inputted text is then written to the file and saved after appending a new line character. The program will ask the user if they want to add more information until the user chooses to stop.

    + If you don't have an IDE, you can use any text editor from your computer and paste the code. 
4. Save the file with a .py extension.
5. Run the code.
    + For text-editor users, open a command prompt or terminal window and locate the folder where the Python file was saved and enter the command provided below by typing it in the command-line interface. After typing the command, press the Enter key to execute.
